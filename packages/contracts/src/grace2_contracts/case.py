"""Case persistence envelopes (FR-MP-6, Appendix A.6/A.7 amendments, sprint-12).

A "Case" is the user-facing name for a `projects` document (FR-MP-5 nomenclature
stays canonical in storage). This module owns the **wire-shape envelopes** that
back the FR-MP-6 Case UX flow:

- ``CaseSummary`` — the left-rail entity (denormalized from ``ProjectDocument``).
- ``CaseChatMessage`` — a single persisted chat exchange in a Case session
  (extends ``ChatMessage`` semantics with per-turn layer/map-command emissions
  so the rehydration replay can re-bind a Case session deterministically).
- ``CaseSessionState`` — the rehydration envelope returned when a user opens
  a Case (the "replay envelope").
- ``CaseListEnvelope`` / ``CaseOpenEnvelope`` — server -> client A.4 messages
  for the left-rail listing and Case open/rehydrate transitions.
- ``CaseCommandEnvelope`` — client -> server A.3 message for Case lifecycle
  commands (``create`` / ``select`` / ``rename`` / ``archive`` / ``delete``).

This module is **Wave 1 of sprint-12-mega**: every downstream Wave 2 Case UX job
(agent and web specialists) consumes these shapes. The shapes are pydantic v2
``GraceModel`` subclasses (the project-wide convention; see ``common.py`` and
``schema.md`` "pydantic v2, not tentative anymore"). The kickoff sketched the
shapes as ``dataclass``; the conservative-interpretation translation to
``GraceModel`` is logged as ``OQ-0099-DATACLASS-VS-PYDANTIC`` in the report.

Invariants this module is responsible for:

- **8. Cancellation is first-class.** ``case-command`` carries no ad-hoc
  cancellation field; cancellation flows through the existing ``cancel``
  message (Appendix A.3), not a Case lifecycle command.
- **9. No cost theater.** No cost field anywhere on Case envelopes — neither
  on ``CaseSummary`` (no aggregate cost), nor on ``CaseCommandEnvelope``, nor
  on the rehydration replay. Cost surfacing is forbidden everywhere (A.4 /
  invariant 9).

SRS references:
- FR-MP-6 (Case UX flow) — `docs/srs/03-functional-requirements.md`.
- Appendix A.3 (client -> server messages) and A.4 (server -> client messages)
  for the envelope-type discipline.
- Appendix D.2 (``projects``) and D.6 (``sessions``) for the underlying storage
  shapes the Case envelopes denormalize from.
